            " '\" \\n\\n  \\n :: OK, TDC, your quote:  \"\"so please dont give me this tired bullshit that we are somehow driving Wikipedia to a right wing bias\"\" - read what I wrote, again.  I told the other two what I\\'m afraid of is Wikipedia being at either extreme.  What I worry about is people coming here on one day and seeing your horseshit, and the next day seeing horseshit of the opposite color; and credibility is already a big problem at wikipedia.  I also ain\\'t pow-wowing with anyone; I won\\'t joining their agenda to get rid of you, at least not until I think that you\\'re hopeless. \\n :: \"\"faced with dozens of editors slugging through community college in their parents basement\"\" - Geez, you\\'re a shitty asshole.  Nice thing to say about people who didn\\'t have the sense to choose the right balls to get shot out of.   \\n ::\"\"there are virtually none to do likewise in the virtual playground that the militant left has here...Look at the validity of my argument, look at the comments from the Castroites, and then tell me who is POV pushing and being uncivil\"\" - TDC, that\\'s exactly the problem with you - you can\\'t even tell why people get mad at you.  What I\\'m seeing happen consistently is that you make an extreme edit to an article, and then you whine when a leftist reverts your entire edit.  And, boy, you get offensive about it, much more offensive than anyone else, and you\\'re always the initiator of the shit-slinging.   \\n ::I understand your \"\"shoot for the stars to get the moon argument\"\" (sorry if I misquote you), but you\\'d probably get more results by making edits that you actually think will stick.  And then you have to lash out like a two-year-old when your edits are reverted - whatdahelldidjaexpect?  Stop taking the reverts so personally. \\n ::I know that you think that the admins are against you for political reasons, but you\\'re flat-out wrong.  You\\'d get more support from the WikiGods if they hadn\\'t first noticed you giving up the higher terrain by being the most insulting person you can be.  It\\'s amazing that this isn\\'t obvious to you.     \\n ::\"\"I give myself 100% chance of remaining here long...\"\" - I do hope you that are here for a long time, just hopefully with a completely different personality.  I know, fat chance. \\n ::A graduate of SERE - normally I\\'d be impressed, but since you pulled this out of your wide-open asshole at a time when it had no relevance to the topic at hand (unless they\\'re now teaching political debate after insect-eating), your comment only clarifies the kind of person you are - an infantile braggart.  You see yourself as some kind of one-man, wrongy persecuted, rebel/hero/patriot, but you actually just made yourself look like the bully in a kid\\'s afteroon special, or about as credible as a gansta rapper who sells his ass on the street when his homies aren\\'t around.  You\\'re just frontin\\' like you\\'re hard, but your reactions to anyone disagreeing with you are like that of a thin-skinned, self-concious, 12 year old girl.   \"'\n",

Writing for wiki certainly don't fit their professionalism.  \\n\\n But secondly, and most importantly, the motherfucking army of wikipedic morons is there to fight whatever insight or serious info professionals may contribute.
